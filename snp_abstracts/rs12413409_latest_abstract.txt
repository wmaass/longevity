<b>Background and Aim</b>: It was evaluated whether the integration of genetic risk scores (GRS-unweighted, wGRS-weighted) into conventional risk factor (CRF) models for coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction (CHD/AMI) could improve the predictive ability of the models. <b>Methods</b>: Subjects and data collected in a previous survey were used to perform regression and ROC curve analyses as well as to examine the role of genetic components. Thirty SNPs were selected, and genotype and phenotype data were available for 558 participants (general: N = 279 and Roma: N = 279). <b>Results</b>: The mean GRS (27.27 ± 3.43 vs. 26.68 ± 3.51, <i>p</i> = 0.046) and wGRS (3.52 ± 0.68 vs. 3.33 ± 0.62, <i>p</i> = 0.001) were significantly higher in the general population. The addition of the wGRS to the CRF model yielded the strongest improvement in discrimination among Roma (from 0.8616 to 0.8674), while the addition of GRS to the CRF model yielded the strongest improvement in discrimination in the general population (from 0.8149 to 0.8160). In addition to that, the Roma individuals were likely to develop CHD/AMI at a younger age than subjects in the general population. <b>Conclusions</b>: The combination of the CRFs and genetic components improved the model's performance and predicted AMI/CHD better than CRFs alone.
