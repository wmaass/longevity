<h4>Background</h4>Recent research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may have a regulatory role in inflammatory processes, potentially influencing the development of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the relationship between UC and lncRNAs remains unclear, highlighting the need for further research in this area.<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to define the possible roles of inflammation-related lncRNA polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of UC.<h4>Method</h4>The study included adult patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with UC (n = 73) and a control group consisting of age-matched healthy individuals without any gastrointestinal complaints (n = 73). The inflammation-related ANRIL (rs10757278, rs1333048), IFNG-AS1 (rs1558744, rs7134599), LINC01430 (rs6017342), LOC101926945 (rs561722) and CCAT2 (rs6983267) polymorphisms were examined using the Fluidigm SNP Type method.<h4>Results</h4>Of UC patients, 34.25% (n = 25) had proctitis, 28.77% (n = 21) had distal colon involvement and 36.98% (n = 27) had total colon involvement. Also, of the UC patients, 45.20% (n = 33) had suffered for 0-5 years, 41.10% (n = 30) for 5-10 years and 13.70% (n = 10) for 10-16 years. According to the pathology results of the most recent colonoscopy performed on UC patients, the disease was active in 60.27% (n = 44) and in remission in 39.73% (n = 29). The genotype distributions of the IFNG-AS1 rs1558744 and CCAT2 rs6983267 polymorphisms between the two groups revealed statistically significant results (p = 0.042 and p = 0.033, respectively). Allele frequency distributions of the IFNG-AS1 rs1558744 polymorphism between the UC and control groups were also statistically significant (p = 0.040). No statistically significant differences were observed when the examined polymorphisms were analyzed in relation to the location of involvement, disease activity state or disease duration in UC patients (p > 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>IFNG-AS1 rs1558744 and CCAT2 rs6983267 polymorphisms may be significant risk factors for the development of UC.
