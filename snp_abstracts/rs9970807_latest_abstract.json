  "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded significant insights into the genetic architecture of myocardial infarction (MI), although studies in non-European populations are still lacking. Saudi Arabian cohorts offer an opportunity to discover novel genetic variants impacting disease risk due to a high rate of consanguinity. Genome-wide genotyping (GWG), imputation and GWAS followed by meta-analysis were performed based on two independent Saudi Arabian studies comprising 3950 MI patients and 2324 non-MI controls. Meta-analyses were then performed with these two Saudi MI studies and the CardioGRAMplusC4D and UK BioBank GWAS as controls. Meta-analyses of the two Saudi MI studies resulted in 17 SNPs with genome-wide significance. Meta-analyses of all 4 studies revealed 66 loci with genome-wide significance levels of p < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>. All of these variants, except rs2764203, have previously been reported as MI-associated loci or to have high linkage disequilibrium with known loci. One SNP association in Shisa family member 5 (SHISA5) (rs11707229) was evident at a much higher frequency in the Saudi MI populations (> 12% MAF). In conclusion, our results replicated many MI associations, whereas in Saudi-only GWAS (meta-analyses), several new loci were implicated that require future validation and functional analyses.",
