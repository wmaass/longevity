The study titled "The Association of ADAMTS7 Gene Polymorphisms with the Risk of Coronary Artery Disease Occurrence and Cardiovascular Survival in the Polish Population: A Case-Control and a Prospective Cohort Study" investigates the relationship between genetic variations (SNPs) in the ADAMTS7 gene and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) occurrence, as well as cardiovascular survival, among the Polish population. The research involves both a case-control study and a prospective cohort, aiming to provide insights into potential genetic factors contributing to CAD in the Polish demographic. However, specific SNPs associated with CAD or survival outcomes were not mentioned in the provided abstract.
