Title: The Aspirin Heart Disease Prevention Conundrum

Summary: This study explores the complexities and controversies surrounding the use of aspirin for heart disease prevention, particularly in high-risk populations. It discusses the potential benefits of aspirin in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, but also highlights concerns about gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse effects. The study emphasizes the need for personalized medicine approaches to determine the most appropriate candidates for aspirin therapy based on individual risk factors and genetic variations (SNPs), such as CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Further research is encouraged to optimize aspirin use in heart disease prevention strategies. [No specific population details are provided in this abstract.]
