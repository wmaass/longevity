The study titled "Feature Selection for Hypertension Risk Prediction Using XGBoost on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Data" aims to predict the risk of hypertension using XGBoost, an efficient tree-based algorithm. The research focuses on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), which are genetic variations occurring when a single DNA building block, or nucleotide, is altered. In this study, the authors analyze SNP data to identify key genetic markers associated with hypertension risk in a specific population, though the exact population details were not specified in the abstract. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can aid in early detection and prevention strategies for hypertension.
