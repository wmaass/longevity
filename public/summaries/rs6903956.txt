The study titled "Coronary Artery Disease Risk Variant rs6903956 Links to Endothelial Dysfunction via PHACTR1 Regulation" (doi: 10.1101/2025.05.11.653298) investigates the association between a specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), rs6903956, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The research reveals that this SNP is linked to endothelial dysfunction, which increases the risk of CAD. The study suggests that this link might be mediated through regulation of the PHACTR1 gene in a specific population, although the detailed demographic information was not provided in the abstract.
