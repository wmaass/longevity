Title: Unraveling the genetic basis of subclinical atherosclerosis: Early genetic detection can improve cardiovascular prevention.

Summary: The study explores the genetic factors contributing to subclinical atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by plaque buildup in arteries before clinically apparent symptoms. The research focuses on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased risk, particularly in specific populations such as Europeans and Asians. Early genetic detection of these SNPs could potentially enhance preventative measures for cardiovascular diseases.
