Here are the findings specifically regarding SNP rs4977574:

* From "Unraveling the genetic basis of subclinical atherosclerosis": The study identified an association between rs4977574 and increased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.27, P = 0.002).
* From "Six genetic variants are associated with cardiovascular disease": The study reported that rs4977574 was one of six genetic variants independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.33, P = 6.6 Ã— 10^(-9)).
* From "Genetic Factors Associated With Myocardial Infarction in Saudi Arabia": The study found that rs4977574 was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.57, P = 0.001).
* No specific findings on rs4977574 were reported in the other two studies.

Overall, these studies suggest that SNP rs4977574 is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and subclinical atherosclerosis, with effect sizes ranging from 1.14 to 1.34.
