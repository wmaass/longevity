The study titled "Genes, environment, and African ancestry in cardiometabolic disorders" explores the genetic and environmental factors contributing to cardiometabolic disorders among individuals with African ancestry. It identifies several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these conditions, including rs7308658 near the APOE gene and rs12740674 in the KCNQ1 gene. The research emphasizes the need for further investigation into the unique genetic susceptibilities and environmental influences on cardiometabolic disorders within African populations.
