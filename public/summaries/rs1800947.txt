Title: Genetics, sex, and platelet-rich plasma usage impact arthrofibrosis development post ACL reconstruction

The study investigates the influence of genetics, sex, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) use on the development of arthrofibrosis after Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction. The research found that certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to inflammation and fibrosis may increase the risk of arthrofibrosis. Furthermore, males were more susceptible to developing the condition compared to females. Lastly, the use of PRP during ACL reconstruction seemed to have a protective effect against arthrofibrosis.

The study population includes patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, though specific demographic details are not provided in this abstract.
