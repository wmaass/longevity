The study titled "Feature Selection for Hypertension Risk Prediction Using XGBoost on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Data" investigates the use of XGBoost, an advanced machine learning algorithm, to predict the risk of hypertension based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The research focuses on a specific population but does not provide explicit details about it in this abstract. The aim is to identify significant SNPs that can contribute to the prediction of hypertension risk more accurately than traditional methods, thereby potentially aiding in early diagnosis and effective management of the disease.
