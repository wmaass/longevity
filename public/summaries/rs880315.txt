The study titled "Effects of CASZ1, WNT2B and PTPRG SNPs on stroke susceptibility in the Chinese Han population" (DOI: 10.1111/eci.14144) investigates the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes – CASZ1, WNT2B, and PTPRG – and stroke susceptibility within the Chinese Han population. The findings suggest that specific alleles of these SNPs may be linked to an increased risk of experiencing a stroke. However, further research is needed to confirm these preliminary observations and explore potential mechanisms underlying this association.
