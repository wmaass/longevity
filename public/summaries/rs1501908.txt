The study titled "Corporate Genome Screening India (CoGsI)" identified several genetic variants linked to Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in a population of young Indian professionals. Notable Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2D include rs7903146, rs1801282, and rs7754840. The research highlights the potential utility of genetic screening for early identification and management of T2D risk among this specific demographic in India.
