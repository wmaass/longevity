The PubMed abstract discusses a case-control study involving 9,534 African American participants that aimed to replicate European hypertension associations. The study identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with hypertension in Europeans, which were also found to be significantly associated with hypertension in the African American population. Notably, two SNPs (rs10754578 and rs693) located on chromosome 2q31 showed particularly strong associations with hypertension in this study. The findings suggest that some of the genetic determinants of hypertension identified in European populations are also relevant for African Americans, highlighting potential shared mechanisms underlying hypertension across different ethnic groups.
