The study titled "Exploring modifiable risk factors: insights from Mendelian randomization analyses of gastric cancer in East Asian populations" (DOI: 10.1007/s12672-025-01953-1) aims to identify potential modifiable risk factors for gastric cancer in East Asian populations using Mendelian randomization analysis. The researchers found significant associations between several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to dietary factors and the risk of gastric cancer. Notably, SNPs associated with folate metabolism and vitamin A showed increased risks, while SNPs linked to alcohol consumption exhibited a protective effect. The study emphasizes the potential for dietary modifications in mitigating the incidence of gastric cancer among East Asian populations.
