The study titled "Coronary artery disease patients with rs7904519 (TCF7L2) are at a persistent risk of type 2 diabetes" suggests a long-term association between carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7904519 variant and an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, even in Coronary Artery Disease patients. The risk persists over time, indicating that this genetic marker may be useful in predicting diabetes development among CAD patients. The study did not specify the population demographics in the provided abstract.
