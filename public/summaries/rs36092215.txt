This study presents a machine learning framework aimed at predicting the age of onset in both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model utilizes a combination of genetic variants, including Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) APOE Îµ4 and rs157582, and clinical features to make accurate predictions. The population analyzed consisted of individuals from various ethnicities, with data sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The research findings suggest that the developed framework could be valuable for improving early diagnosis and targeted interventions in AD.
