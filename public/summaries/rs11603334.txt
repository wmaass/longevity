The study titled "Causal Relationship Between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Preeclampsia" is a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis aimed at determining the causal relationship between these two conditions. Using genetic variants (SNPs) associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, the study found no evidence of a causal effect on preeclampsia. Conversely, genetic predisposition to preeclampsia was not found to have a significant impact on the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. This research suggests that there may be no direct causal link between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and preeclampsia in the general population.
