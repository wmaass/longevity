This study aims to replicate findings from European hypertension association studies in a case-control analysis of 9,534 African American participants. The research focused on identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with hypertension. Despite finding several SNPs common between the populations, the results did not fully replicate the findings from European studies, suggesting potential ethnic differences in hypertension-associated genetic variants among African Americans. The study emphasizes the importance of considering ethnic diversity in investigations of complex diseases like hypertension.
