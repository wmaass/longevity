The study titled "Sex-Specific Features of the Correlation between GWAS-Noticeable Polymorphisms and Hypertension in Europeans of Russia" explores the correlation between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hypertension in European Russians, divided by sex. The research identifies several SNPs associated with hypertension, including rs1706366, rs9349379, and rs12523822 for females, and rs7411, rs1706366, and rs10754578 for males. Notably, the findings suggest that certain SNPs correlate differently between males and females in the development of hypertension among European Russians.
