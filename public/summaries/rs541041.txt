The study titled "Risk Allele Frequency Analysis of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Vitamin D Concentrations in Different Ethnic Groups" (doi: 10.3390/genes12101530) explores the frequency of risk alleles associated with Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting vitamin D concentrations among various ethnic groups. The research found significant differences in the distribution of these SNPs between different populations, which could potentially impact vitamin D levels and contribute to health disparities related to vitamin D deficiency. Specific SNPs mentioned include rs10745658, rs2282679, rs1544410, and rs7041.
