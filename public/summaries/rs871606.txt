The study titled "Recapitulation of genome-wide association studies on pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure in the Korean population" (DOI: 10.1038/jhg.2012.31) aims to replicate findings from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a Korean population. The researchers identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PP and MAP, including rs17084958 near the gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which was significantly associated with both PP and MAP in the Korean population. Although some of these associations were weaker than those reported in other ethnic groups, this study supports the notion that genetic factors contribute to variations in blood pressure among different populations.
