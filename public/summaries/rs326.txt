The research note evaluates the potential for vertical transmission (transmission from parent to offspring) of Salmonella Reading in broiler breeders. The study found that Salmonella Reading was present in 16.7% of the egg samples collected from infected broiler breeders, suggesting a possible risk of vertical transmission. However, no bacteria were detected in the hatchlings, indicating potential limitations in the vertical transmission efficiency of this strain. The research highlights the importance of monitoring and controlling Salmonella infection in poultry production to prevent contamination of eggs and subsequent foodborne illnesses. No specific population details or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were mentioned in the abstract.
