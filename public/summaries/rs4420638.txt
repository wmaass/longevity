The study titled "Trustworthy causal biomarker discovery" presents a multiomics approach to brain imaging genetics, aiming to discover reliable causal biomarkers for various neurological conditions. This method integrates genetic and imaging data from multiple omics levels (genome, transcriptome, proteome, etc.) across diverse populations. The focus is on identifying Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with specific brain structures or functions that could serve as potential biomarkers for neurological diseases. However, details about specific diseases or population groups are not provided in the abstract.
