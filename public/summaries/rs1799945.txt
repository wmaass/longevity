The study titled "Polymorphic Distribution of Human Homeostatic Iron Regulator Gene H63D rs1799945 and Clinico-Hematological Parameters of Sickle Cell Anemia Patients: A Case-Control Study in Northern Ghana" investigates the distribution of a specific genetic variant (H63D SNP) within the human homeostatic iron regulator gene among sickle cell anemia patients in northern Ghana. The research aims to correlate this genetic variation with clinical and hematological parameters in both sickle cell anemia patients and control groups. The results of this case-control study could potentially provide insights into the role of H63D SNP in the pathophysiology and management of sickle cell anemia within this specific population in Ghana.
