The PubMed abstract discusses the association of specific genetic variants (SNPs) with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The study focuses on two variant loci: cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP -rs708272) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL -rs13702). The findings suggest that certain genotypes predicted by these variants may increase the risk of CVD. Notably, the study indicates that populations with Native American ancestry have the highest risk associated with these genotypes.
