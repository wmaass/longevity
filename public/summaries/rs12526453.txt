The study titled "Influence of genetic polymorphisms on serum biomarkers of cardiac health" investigates the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on various cardiac biomarkers in a population-based cohort. Specifically, it focuses on common SNPs in genes associated with lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and how these SNPs affect levels of biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and lipids such as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The research provides insight into the role of genetic variations in cardiac health and potential risk stratification for heart disease.
