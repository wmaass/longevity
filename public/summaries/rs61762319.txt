This study investigates potential causal associations and shared genetic etiology between neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and constipation. The research identifies several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with both NDDs and constipation in the population, suggesting a possible common genetic basis for these conditions. Notable among these SNPs is rs1800469 within the SLC26A3 gene, which has been linked to both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and constipation. The study highlights the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms connecting NDDs and constipation at the genetic level.
