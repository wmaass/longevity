The PubMed abstract titled "Genetic Factors Associated with Intraocular Inflammation After Brolucizumab Administration in Patients with Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration" investigates the potential link between genetic factors and the occurrence of intraocular inflammation following treatment with brolucizumab for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study found that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes like TGFBI, C2orf34, and ARMS2 may contribute to an increased risk of inflammation. It is important to note that this research was conducted among a population primarily composed of European ancestry patients. The findings emphasize the importance of further studies to validate these associations and to explore their potential implications for personalized medicine in AMD treatment.
