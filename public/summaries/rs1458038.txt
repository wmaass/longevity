This study, published as "Renal function and risk of dementia: a Mendelian randomization study," explores the potential link between renal function (kidney function) and the risk of developing dementia. The researchers utilized a Mendelian randomization approach, which leverages genetic variants (SNPs) associated with kidney function to reduce bias in observational studies. They found that decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of renal function, was significantly associated with an increased risk of dementia in the general population, suggesting that impaired kidney function might be a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia.
