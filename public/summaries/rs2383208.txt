The study titled "Genomic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus among Filipinos" (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0312291) identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with an increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Filipino populations. The research focuses on analyzing whole-genome sequencing data from T2DM patients and healthy controls, revealing several novel and known SNPs related to the disease. Notably, the study highlights that these genetic variants may contribute to a significant proportion of T2DM cases within this specific population.
