Title: Association of Lipoprotein A rs10455872 Polymorphism with Childhood Obesity and Obesity-Related Outcomes

Summary: The study investigates the correlation between the rs10455872 variant in the Lipoprotein A (LPA) gene and childhood obesity, as well as obesity-related outcomes. The research was conducted on a Chinese Han population, where it was found that the minor allele of the rs10455872 SNP is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) in children aged 6-18 years and higher levels of serum LPA concentrations. Additionally, the presence of this variant was linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia in obese individuals. This suggests that the rs10455872 SNP in the LPA gene may play a role in the development and progression of childhood obesity and its complications.
