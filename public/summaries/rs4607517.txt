The study titled "Identification of Novel Genetic Variants and Food Intake Factors Associated with Type 2 Diabetes in South Korean Adults" explores genetic variants linked to Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in the South Korean population. Utilizing an Illness-Death model, the research identified novel Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that may contribute to T2D risk. Additionally, the analysis examined food intake factors associated with T2D development, providing potential dietary modifications for disease prevention in South Korean adults.
