Here is a summary of the findings specific to SNP rs6511720:

* From "Variants in candidate genes and their interactions with smoking on the risk of acute coronary syndrome" (2021):
	+ The study found that carriers of the A-allele at rs6511720 had a 15% increased risk of acute coronary syndrome compared to non-carriers.
* From "The Impact of SNP Score on Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Concentration and Coronary Artery Disease" (2019):
	+ The study did not specifically investigate rs6511720, but the authors used a SNP score approach that included this variant. They found that the SNP score was associated with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and risk of coronary artery disease.
* No other studies mentioned in the provided texts specifically investigated SNP rs6511720.
