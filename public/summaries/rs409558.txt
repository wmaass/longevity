The PubMed abstract titled "Characterizing the polygenic overlap and shared loci between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cardiovascular diseases" explores the genetic similarities between RA and cardiovascular diseases. The study identifies shared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between these two conditions, suggesting a possible genetic basis for the increased risk of cardiovascular complications in individuals with RA. The population under investigation is not explicitly stated, but it likely includes individuals diagnosed with RA who also have cardiovascular diseases or are at risk for them. The research aims to improve understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms linking these two conditions and potentially pave the way for more targeted prevention strategies and treatments.
