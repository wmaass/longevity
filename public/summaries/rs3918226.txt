The PubMed abstract suggests a study that identifies the promoter polymorphism rs3918226 of the Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) gene as a potential novel susceptibility marker for Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). The researchers examined a population cohort to assess the association between this specific genetic variant and the risk of developing PAD. The findings indicate that individuals carrying the minor allele (T-allele) have an increased susceptibility to PAD, thereby implying a potential role of eNOS gene variants in the pathogenesis of PAD.
