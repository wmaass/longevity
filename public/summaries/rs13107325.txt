The study titled "Shared genetic basis for brain structure, insulin resistance, and inflammation in schizophrenia: a colocalization study" (doi: 10.1101/2025.07.23.666268) investigates the potential shared genetic factors contributing to abnormal brain structure, insulin resistance, and inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia. The research highlights several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are believed to be associated with these conditions, specifically mentioning their influence on hippocampal volume, metabolic function, and neuroinflammatory markers. While the study does not explicitly specify the population demographic, it is presumed that the participants are individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.
