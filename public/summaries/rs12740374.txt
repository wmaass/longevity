The study titled "Pleiotropic Effects of an eQTL in the CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1 Cluster That Associates With LDL-C and Resting Metabolic Rate" (doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgae498) identifies a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1 gene cluster that is associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and resting metabolic rate. The research was conducted on European ancestry individuals, suggesting potential genetic factors influencing these two crucial health indicators in this population. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the implications for other ethnicities and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these pleiotropic effects.
