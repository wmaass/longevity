The study titled "Coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors affected by RNA modification-related genetic variants" explores the impact of genetic variations associated with RNA modifications on CAD risk factors. The research identifies specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to RNA modifications, such as METTL3 and FTO, that are linked to increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, known CAD risk factors. The study was conducted on a Chinese Han population, demonstrating that these genetic variations may contribute to the development of CAD in this specific demographic.
