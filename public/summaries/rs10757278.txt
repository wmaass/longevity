This study, published in Journal of Clinical Medicine, is a hospital-based case-control analysis aimed at identifying genetic variants associated with preeclampsia during pregnancy. The research focused on 200 cases of pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia and 200 controls without the condition. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could be linked to the disease. Interestingly, significant associations were found between preeclampsia and specific SNPs located on chromosomes 12 and 16 in the studied population. Further investigation is recommended for validating these findings and understanding their implications for preeclampsia risk assessment and management.
