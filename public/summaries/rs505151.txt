The study titled "Association of APOB (rs515135) and PCSK9 (rs505151) gene polymorphisms with CAD in the Indian population" examines the relationship between specific genetic variations, namely APOB (rs515135) and PCSK9 (rs505151), and coronary artery disease (CAD) within the Indian population. The results suggest that these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might play a role in CAD susceptibility among Indians, although further research may be needed to confirm this association.
