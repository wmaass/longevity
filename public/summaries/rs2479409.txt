Title: Gain of function variants in PCSK9 gene in high-risk patients after myocardial infarction with elevated lipoprotein (a) levels, treated with statins.

Summary: This study identifies gain-of-function variants in the PCSK9 gene in high-risk patients who have experienced myocardial infarction and show increased lipoprotein (a) values while being treated with statins. These specific genetic variations might contribute to the persistence or recurrence of cardiovascular disease by impacting LDL cholesterol levels, as PCSK9 is a key regulator in cholesterol metabolism. The population in focus consists of patients who have had a myocardial infarction and are undergoing statin therapy.
