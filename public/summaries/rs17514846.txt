Abstract Summary:

This study explores the role of Furin, a protease enzyme, in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Furin is involved in the processing of various proteins related to CVD, such as matrix metalloproteinases and growth factors. The study suggests that genetic variations (SNPs) in the Furin gene may influence an individual's susceptibility to CVD, particularly in populations with a higher prevalence of CVD, like individuals of African descent. The research implies that targeting Furin could potentially offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing and preventing CVD.

Highlights:
- Furin enzyme has a significant role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through processing relevant proteins (matrix metalloproteinases, growth factors).
- Genetic variations (SNPs) in the Furin gene may affect an individual's susceptibility to CVD.
- Population with higher CVD prevalence, such as individuals of African descent, may be particularly impacted by these genetic variations.
- Potential therapeutic strategies for managing and preventing CVD could involve targeting Furin enzyme.
