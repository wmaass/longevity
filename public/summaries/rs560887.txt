The study titled "CRY2 (rs11605924) and G6PC2 (rs560887) single nucleotide polymorphisms increase risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus" identifies two specific genetic variants, rs11605924 in the CRY2 gene and rs560887 in the G6PC2 gene, as risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The research was published in BioMed Research International and provides evidence that these SNPs may play a significant role in susceptibility to this disease. Although population-specific details are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, it is implied that these findings could have broad implications for understanding genetic predispositions to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus across various populations.
