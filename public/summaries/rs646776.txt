The study titled "Genetic Evidence of Causal Effect between C1q/TNF-Related Protein-1 and Atherosclerosis" is a Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis aimed at investigating the causal relationship between C1q/TNF-related protein-1 (CTRP1) and atherosclerosis. The authors found significant evidence suggesting a causal effect where higher levels of CTRP1 could potentially increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. No specific population details were mentioned in the abstract provided. The study employed bidirectional and multivariate MR methods, implying that it accounted for potential confounding factors and assessed whether the effect was also present in reverse (atherosclerosis causing increased CTRP1 levels).
