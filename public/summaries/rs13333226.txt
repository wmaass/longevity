The study titled "UMOD Genotype-Blinded Trial of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Response to Torasemide" investigates the effect of torasemide, a loop diuretic, on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in participants with hypertension. The research was conducted blinded to UMOD genotype, a variant associated with kidney function and blood pressure regulation. Although the specific population demographics were not detailed in this abstract, the focus is on individuals with hypertension. No mention of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to ABP was found in the provided abstract.
