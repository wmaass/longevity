The study titled "The Role of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors in the Severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in Pediatric Patients" (doi: 10.7759/cureus.74477) investigates the association between specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in beta-2 adrenergic receptors and the severity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in pediatric patients. The study found that certain SNPs, particularly rs1042713 and rs1801926, were significantly associated with OSAS severity, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to this condition in children. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical significance of these SNPs in pediatric OSAS.
