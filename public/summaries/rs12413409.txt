Title: Genetic diagnosis and clinical analysis of 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency combined with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A case report

Summary: This case report presents a unique instance of a patient diagnosed with 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency (CAH), an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, accompanied by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The patient, belonging to a consanguineous family, showed symptoms such as ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. Genetic testing revealed a novel homozygous missense variant in the CYP17A1 gene, which is associated with both conditions. This case highlights the need for genetic evaluation in patients presenting with CAH and T2DM, potentially leading to improved management strategies.
