The knee and the back of the ankle (at the Achilles tendon) are the most commonly affected parts of the body. The underlying cause of enthesitis-related juvenile idiopathic arthritis is currently unknown (idiopathic). It is very rare for more than one member of a family to have juvenile arthritis; however, research suggests that having a family member with juvenile arthritis or any autoimmune disease may increase the risk of having juvenile arthritis, in general.
